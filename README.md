# Gym Customer Churn Prediction

In this project, I used a dataset from Kaggle to predict customer churn for a gym. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and building a machine learning model to predict customer churn.

## Project Summary:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and outliers.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualized customer behavior and churn distribution.
- **Machine Learning**: Built a Logistic Regression model with an accuracy of 92.6%.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Used confusion matrix and classification report for evaluation.

## Technologies Used:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
